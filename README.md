# Maze Walking with Q Learning

A Machine Learning Project: A simple maze walking game using reinforcement learning algorithm, Q learning algorithm. Powered by the HTML5 game engine Egret.

## How to Run the game

**I will release the final runable version at some point, but for now you have to build it yourself.**

You need to download the IDE [Egret Wing](https://egret.com/en/products/wing.html) for this project. Open this project in the IDE and then you can build or debug it yourself.
